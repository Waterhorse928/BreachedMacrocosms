Aunn: Hello Mr. Butterfly! 
Aunn: It's a nice day, isn't it?
Aunn: The sun feels so nice...
Aunn: Hmm? Someone's coming!
Aunn: Bye Mr. Butterfly!
???: Hey, look Pikachu! There's a building over there!
Pikachu: Pika!
???: Yeah! Who ever lives there can tell us where we are!
???: Let's go!
Aunn: Hey slow down! Who are you and what's your business?
???: Erm, I'm Ash Ketchum! And I have no idea where I am...
???: Wait, aren't you a Pokemon?
Aunn: Huh? I don't think so?
Aunn: Anyway, this is the Hakurei Shrine.
Aunn: That path there leads back to the village.
Ash: Oh! Thank you, Miss- um, what's your name?
Aunn: I'm Aunn Komano the komainu! I protect this shrine!
Ash: Whoa! That's pretty cool!
Ash: I'm a Pokemon Trainer!
Ash: This is my partner, Pikachu!
Pikachu: Pikachu!
Aunn: It was nice to meet you Mr. Ketchum and Pikachu!
Ash: You too, Miss Komano!
Ash: Well, I'd best go now. See ya!
Aunn: Bye!
Aunn: Huh!? That aura...
Ash: What's wrong Miss Komano?
Aunn: Look! Over there!
Ash: Ah! What are those things? Are they zombies?
Aunn: I don't know, but I can sense a force of pure evil directing them.
Ash: Wow, that's bad!
Pikachu: Piiika...
Risen: Grrrr...
Risen: Graaah!!!
Ash: They're coming this way!
