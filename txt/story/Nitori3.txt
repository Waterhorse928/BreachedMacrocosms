Outside Kourindou
Marisa: That was pretty impressive kid!
Ruby: Oh uh, thanks! You were really cool too!
Ruby: I've never seen someone ride around on a broom before!
Ruby: It's like you're a real-life witch!
Marisa: I'm just Marisa, the Ordinary Magician!
Ruby: I'm Ruby! The Ordinary... Scythe-person?
Marisa: I think you've already introduced yourself.
Ruby: ...
Ruby: So I have!
Marisa: And this is Nitori, Super Bashful Warhead!
Nitori: Marisa! Let go of me! I wasn't going anywhere!
Ruby: Is she normally transparent?
Marisa: When she wants to be. She's like a chameleon!
Nitori: I'm nothing like a chameleon! My optical camouflage suit actually bends the light-
Marisa: Yeah, yeah, tell me about it over lunch.
Nitori: Lunch? What about Ruby?!
Marisa: Well, can't she have lunch with us?
Ruby: I'm hungry!
Nitori: Isn't she from outside Gensokyo though?
Marisa: We can deal with that after lunch. Ruby, do you like soba?
Ruby: I'm willing to try!
Marisa: Nitori?
Nitori: ...
Nitori: I want cucumber soba. 
Marisa: Then it's settled! Come on, I know the perfect place!
