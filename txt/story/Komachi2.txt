Komachi: Geez, there sure are a lot of them...
King Knight: Hohoho! At this rate I won't have to raise a hand! Befitting of a king!
Sain: Don't lose heart! We must not fall whist these people need our help!
Komachi: S'true enough. I just thought it'd be nice if we could take a break.
Marisa: Aren't you slacking off right now though? That'd be a break from a break.
Komachi: That's hardly noteable. I once took a break that was four recursions deep.
Sain: Are these comrades of yours? Help would be greatly appreciated!
Ruby: Of course! Ruby Rose huntress in training is always ready to help!
Nitori: Do those rats have propellers attached to them? Marisa, help me catch one!
Marisa: Sure, sure. Let's even the odds here first, then we can have lunch.
Komachi: Lunch sounds nice! I was thinking about having soba myself.
Ruby: No way! Us too!
King Knight: Grr... Enough! It looks like I'll have to take matters into my own hands!
