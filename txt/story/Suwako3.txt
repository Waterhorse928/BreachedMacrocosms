Outside Moriya Shrine
Sanae: I believe that's the last of them.
Suwako: So anyway, you don't know what Gensokyo is huh?
Sanae: What? Why wouldn't he know what Gensokyo is?
Layton: If I might interject, what is Gensokyo?
Suwako: See! What did I say?
Sanae: Lady Suwako, what does this mean?
Layton: Pardon me, but-
Suwako: It means he's not from Gensokyo.
Sanae: What? How did he get here then?
Layton: Miss Sanae and Lady Suwako! I must ask you to explain yourselves!
Sanae: Eh?
Suwako: All right. Gensokyo is a place where youkai and other mythical beings live separated from the Outside World.
Layton: Thank you.
Sanae: I'm sorry Professor. I forgot myself.
Layton: It's quite alright. Lady Suwako, let's cut to the chase. What do you suggest we do?
Suwako: Hmm. If it's about the Barrier, we'll need to talk to either Reimu or Yukari. They'll probably know what's up.
Sanae: I don't know where Yukari lives, so I guess that leaves Reimu?
Suwako: Alright then, let's go!
Sanae: Ah, you're coming with us Lady Suwako?
Suwako: Of course! I can feel something more interesting is going on.
Sanae: Do you think it's an incident?
Suwako: Maybe.
Layton: I suppose we'll just have to investigate!
