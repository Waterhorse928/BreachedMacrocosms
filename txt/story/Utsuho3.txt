--Remains of Blazing Hell--
Team Rocket: We're blasting off again!
Orin: Okuu, wasn't that last attack kinda overkill?
Utsuho: ...was it?
Orin: ...
Orin: Nevermind.
Lea: !!!
Orin: Okuu's pretty cool huh?
Lea: *nods*
Utsuho: I'm the strongest!
Orin: ...
Orin: Where have I heard that before?
Utsuho: Uh... I'm not sure?
Lea: Wait! Lea meet! Where? Where?
Orin: Oh right! Satori-sama! Let's get going!
Orin: Wait, can you fly?
Lea: ...
Lea: What?
Orin: Don't worry, Utsuho can carry you. Let's hurry up!
Utsuho: Yeah!
Lea: !!!
Lea: What? Wait! HOW!!!
Utsuho: THIS IS THE POWER OF NUCLEAR FUSION!!!
--Palace of the Earth Spirits--
Satori: I think I like this tea.
Satori: I'll have to have Orin get more next time she's out...
    NEEOOOOOOWWW...
    BOOM!!!
Satori: Speaking of which it seems they're back.
Satori: Huh?
Satori: They've brought someone with them?
Satori: It seems things are about to get busy...
Orin: Satori-sama! We're back!
Utsuho: Satori-sama! I hardly crashed into anything!
Lea: Wh-Why...
Satori: Oh dear, what has the cat dragged in this time?
Utsuho: I helped too!
Satori: Indeed you did.
Satori: Ah, excuse me Lea. My name is Satori Komeiji. I am the mistress of this place, the Palace of the Earth Spirits.
Satori: And yes, I can read minds.
Lea: Hi! Hi! Hi!
Satori: Don't worry. With your permissson I'd like to take a look at your past. It that alright with you?
Lea: ...
Lea: ...*nods*
Satori: Thank you.
Satori: ...
Satori: My, you've had quite an exciting life, haven't you?
Lea: *nods*
Satori: Do you mind if I reveal your true nature? Orin already suspects as much.
Lea: *shakes head*
Satori: Lea is not human. She is a highly advanced AI. Some would argue nearly perfect.
Orin: Ah! That's why she doesn't smell human. 
Utsuho: Woah... You're a robot? That's so cool!
Lea: Thanks!
Satori: Lea is honored.
Orin: Ah, but-
Satori: About that, her speech module does not work correctly. She can only say a select few words.
Satori: Futhermore, she seems to struggle to comunicate non-verbally as well. She has not been able to learn how to write.
Satori: She seems almost unable to express words in any fashion. She is one of the stranger minds I've encountered.
Utsuho: Oh... That's sad.
Orin: Don't worry Lea. Okuu and I understand not being able to talk.
Utsuho: Yeah! We'll help you however we can!
Lea: *nods* *nods*
Satori: She is very grateful.
Orin: ...
Satori: Ah yes, you are correct Orin. Lea is not from Gensokyo. I don't believe she's even from the outside world.
Satori: I believe she may be from another reality entirely.
Orin: Is that even possible?
Satori: I am not certain. Whatever the case, it would be best if we could contact Yukari Yukumo.
