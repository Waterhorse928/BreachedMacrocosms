Marisa: Hey Kourin! Got anything interesting today?
Rinnosuke: Do you ever knock? Well anyway I actually do have something to show you.
Marisa: Well what is it? Don’t keep me waiting!
Rinnosuke: Just a moment. I put it back here. Ah here it is.
Marisa: Is it a ball?
Rinnosuke: It’s called a 20Q. It’s a mind-reading device!  
Rinnosuke: It asks questions and using your answers it’ll read your mind!
Rinnosuke: It’s used in interrogations to read the mind of a potential criminal.
Rinnosuke: You see they take the criminal to a dark room, then they-
Marisa: Yeah yeah, can I try?
Rinnosuke: Here. I’ve tried it myself.
Rinnosuke: It only seems to work if you are thinking about a rather basic object.
Marisa: I see. Hmmm... Ok I’ve got something.
Beep boop
Marisa: Is it a person? Not even close.
Marisa: ...
Marisa: Wait how do I-
Rinnosuke: You need to push-
Marisa: Push the buttons, got it.
Boop Beep
Nitori: What have you got there Marisa?
Rinnosuke: You know, some customers do actually knock.
Marisa: It’s a mind-reading device!
Nitori: Whoa! Can I have it?
Marisa: No! You’d just take it apart!
Nitori: But, I always put it back together again!
Marisa: True... You can have it when I’m done with it.
Rinnosuke: Do I get any say in this?
CRASH
Nitori: What was that?
Rinnosuke: Don’t look at me.
BANG BANG
???: Take everything not nailed down! This haul will fund the Morgan Empire!
Marisa: Sounds like someone’s takin’ your stuff Kourin.
Rinnosuke: Ah! Marisa! You have to stop them!
Marisa: Can I keep this?
Rinnosuke: ...Fine.
Marisa: Pleasure doin’ business. Come on Nitori.
Nitori: Wah? Why me?
Marisa: Don’t you want to look at this thing later?
Marisa: Let’s go take out those thieves and I’ll let you look at it.
Nitori: You already said I could have it!
Marisa: Ah, but I didn’t say you could look at it!
Rinnosuke: She’s got you there.
Nitori: That doesn’t make any sense at all. I was going to come help anyway.
Marisa: Then it’s decided! Let’s go!
Rinnosuke: Don’t use your broom-
CRASH
Rinnosuke: -in the shop...
Nitori: See you later!
Rinnosuke: *sigh*
