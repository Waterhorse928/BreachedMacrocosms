Outside Moriya Shrine
Sanae: Lady Suwako, I think they’re retreating!
Suwako: Aww, done already?
???: That was quite a nasty spot of trouble I was in. I thank you ever so much for your help.
Sanae: Ah? Oh, no problem, exterminating is my job! I don’t think we’ve met before, what’s your name?
Layton: I forget myself, I am Professor Hershel Layton. What is your name?
Sanae: I am Sanae Kochiya and this is Lady Suwako.
Layton: It’s nice to meet you Miss Kochiya and-
Suwako: Yes, yes, anyway, do you know what those things were?
Layton: I haven't the foggiest idea. They resemble a sort of humanoid wolf monster but other than that...
Sanae: If you’ve never seen them before Lady Suwako, then where could they have come from?
Layton: If you don’t mind my asking, do you know where we are right now? I must say I'm quite turned around.
Sanae: It’s good you showed up here then! This is the Moriya Shrine.
Layton: Moriya Shine? I’m sorry, I’ve never heard of it before... Hmm...
Suwako: Some professor. Doesn’t even know what the Moriya Shrine is. Hey Sanae, does the village have many professors?
Sanae: Now that you mention it, does the village have any professors?
Layton: Village? Which village are you talking about?
Layton: Oh dear, it seems we’ll have to talk in a little bit. They’ve regrouped.
Sanae: What?
Suwako: Yay! More wolfies to play with!
