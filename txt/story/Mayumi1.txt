Near the Former Capital
Mayumi: *sigh*
Mayumi: Lady Keiki said to take the day off and enjoy myself,
Mayumi: but I enjoy serving Lady Keiki!
Mayumi: Bah! I shouldn't doubt her!
Mayumi: I know Lady Keiki always has a good reason.
Mayumi: My priority is to complete Lady Keiki's assignment.
Mayumi: I must figure out how to enjoy myself, without serving Lady Keiki!
???: Hey! *pant* You in the armor! *pant* You've got to help me!
Mayumi: Hmm?
???: *pant* My name's Usopp. *pant* You're pretty strong right?
Mayumi: You're a human aren't you? How'd you get down here?
Usopp: I don't know! I tried to talk to those horned people, but they got really angry!
Mayumi: The Oni huh? I know they don't like humans, but it's a bit harder to make them actually angry...
Mayumi: Oh! You didn't lie or trick them, did you?
Usopp: What? No! I would never do that! Honest Captain Usopp, that's what them call me!
Mayumi: Hmm... If that's not it, I wonder what could have happened?
Usopp: Ah! I can see them now! Armor Lady, you've got to help me!
Mayumi: Hmm... Ah! Captain Usopp, do you know how to have fun?
Usopp: Huh? 
Usopp: Um, yes! Of course! I'm the best at having fun!
Usopp: Honest Party Captain Ussop the Fun Guy! That's what they call me as well!
Usopp: I've hosted a thousand and one parties and I've never once received a complaint!
Mayumi: This is perfect! I'll lend you my aid, and you'll teach me to enjoy myself!
Mayumi: This is a most fortunate turn of events!
Mayumi: Come on, Honest Party Captain Ussop! To battle!
