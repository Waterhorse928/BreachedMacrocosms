Human Village
Komachi: Ah... It's such a nice day...
Komachi: It's the type of day you could have hot or cold soba with no regrets...
Komachi: Hmm? What's going on over there?
Goldarmor: Make way! Make way! Your King will now address you!
Komachi: ...
Komachi: I'd better check this out...
???: Greetings, Peasants! Rejoice for I am King Knight!
King Knight: I will, as of today, be claiming this village as my own!
King Knight: Though shabby and unbefitting my radiance, it will do for now.
King Knight: Now, take me to your finest dining hall! We will now have a celebration feast!
!!!: Stop right there!
King Knight: Hmm? Who dares address me in such a manner?
!!!: I dare! For I am Sain, Former Knight of House Caelin!
Sain: What kind of king demands such hardship of subjects?
Sain: Ask no more of these kind people, other than your forgiveness, and begone!
King Knight: The impudence! I will not be mocked! Goldarmors! Take that peasant hostage!
Girl: Ah!
Sain: What villainy! I will not allow you!
King Knight: Careful what you say fool! It wouldn't do if something were to happen to this one!
Sain: Grr...
King Knight: Good, good. Now where were we...
Komachi: Looks like you're having a hard time. Mind if I step in?
Sain: Huh?
King Knight: What? Where is the hostage? You dunce!
Komachi: Right over here. Your attempted kidnapping means nothing to my distance.
Komachi: Normally, I wouldn't involve myself in such matters, but I can't have you making more work for me.
King Knight: ARRGH! No more games! Goldarmors! Advance!
