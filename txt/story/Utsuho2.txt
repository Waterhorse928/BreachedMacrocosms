--Remains of Blazing Hell--
Grunt A: These people are crazy!
Grunt B: Who fights a Pokémon?
Grunt C: Well, I saw something on TV one time...
Utsuho: Since we won... does that mean we get your Pokémon?
Grunt A: Urk! Well... Um...
Grunt B: You can't! Because... uh...
Grunt C: We don't... have any?
Utsuho: Oh... I wanted to see a Pokémon...
Orin: Okuu, I think the things we fought were Pokémon.
Utsuho: Do you think so? They are pretty cool! I like the puddle one.
Grunt C: Ah! No! Not my Muk!
Grunt B: You can't just take our Pokémon!
Orin: ...
Orin: Wasn't that exactly what you were doing?
Grunt B: Oh yeah.
Orin: Well I have a better idea anyway...
Utsuho: Aww...
Orin: Didn't someone say something about money?
Utsuho: Oh yeah! Give us all your money!
Grunt A: ...
Grunt A: Guys? Why are you looking at me like that?
--Nearby--
???: Ugh... Where are we?
!!!: Shhh! There might be people nearby!
***: How could anyone live here? It's blazing!
!!!: ...
???: What are you doing?
!!!: I'm thinking. You should try it sometime.
!!!: Listen, if we're in a place we've never been too, then there can only be one reason we're here...
???: It's a vacation?
***: We're lost?
!!!: I don't think so. We must be scouts.
???: Ah! And that means we need to do what we usually do!
All: Steal Pokémon!
--Later--
Orin: How did those people get in here?
Orin: And this money is really strange too...
Utsuho: Hmm... Maybe I can eat it?
Orin: Maybe?
Orin: I'm not even sure how to describe it...
Orin: I think we should take it to that store owner Marisa mentioned first.
Orin: Wait, I think someone else is here now.
===: Hi!
Utsuho: Hello! Do you have any Pokémon?
===: What?
Orin: Don't worry about it. What's your name?
===: Lea.
Orin: Nice to meet you, Lea. I'm Orin.
Orin: Do you know why so many people are showing up here today?
Lea: *shakes head*
Orin: Why are you here then?
Lea: *shakes head*
Utsuho: You don't want to say?
Lea: *shakes head*
Orin: You... can’t?
Lea: *nods* *nods*
Utsuho: ...
Utsuho: Didn't you say something earlier?
Lea: Sorry...
Utsuho: Unyu? I'm so confused...
Orin: Hmm... can you only talk about some things?
Lea: ... *nods*
Orin: Hmm... 
Orin: I've got it! Let's take you to Satori-sama!
Lea: Who?
Utsuho: Yeah! Satori-sama's the best! She can read your mind!
Lea: !!! Lea meet where?
Orin: Wow that was almost a full sentence!
Utsuho: She must be excited!
Utsuho: What are we waiting for? Let's go!
!!!: Not so fast, we'll stop you right there!
???: We're unsurpassed, just to make you aware!
!!!: Prepare for trouble!
???: And make it double!
!!!: To protect the world from devastation!
???: To unite all people within our nation!
!!!: To denounce the evils of truth and love!
???: To extend our reach to the stars above!
!!!: Jessie!
???: James!
Jessie: Team Rocket blast off at the speed of light!
James: Surrender now or prepare to fight!
***: Meowth, that's right!
Orin: ...
Orin: More of these guys?
Utsuho: Do you think they have more Pokémon?
Lea: ...
Lea: What?
Jessie: They can talk!
James: I guess they aren't Pokémon...
Meowth: They've been talking for awhile now!
Meowth: Nevermind... Look at what they're holding!
Jessie: Is that...
James: Money?
Meowth: Yeah, you dimwits! Now fight them!
Jessie: Right! Go Arbok!
James: Weezing! I choose you!
Meowth: Meowth, front and center!
