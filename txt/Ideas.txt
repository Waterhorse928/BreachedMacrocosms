Yukari has a cold because,
She was experimenting with a ability ampliphiyer.
Ran, who normally works on this with her, is preocupied by Chen.
Yukari ends up working on the experiment without Ran.
Yukari makes a mistake and Ran isn't there to activate the failsafe.
Her ablity is amped but she can't control it.

Dimentio picks up the idea of trapping people in a dimension where he's more powerful thanks to Yukari.

I want Komachi to be at the human village

RWBY is set from before the fall of beacon
Shovel knight is set after the events of plague of shadows, at the start of shovel of hope
or at least that's when this king knight is from

Time is screwy, give content to when the characters are from.

Who needs orginazation anyway? I'm just going to write down all my ideas

I could involve a batman villain
also I want to inlude a OC cause I can.

I don't think I need to think so hard.

Mayumi shows up at the former Captital uncertain about what to do
Lady Keiki insisted that she try "taking a day off"
She doesn't think much for the idea, but that means nothing in the face of her orders
she will enjoy herself as instucted.
Ussop angered the Oni and desperately asks Mayumi for help.
Mayumi agrees with the promise that Ussop will teach her how to have fun.

Komachi is hanging out at the human village for lunch,
but King Knight is making a ruckus
A valiant knight appears and confronts him!
it's Sain
King Knight orders a Goldarmor to attack a villager
Komachi steps in to stop him.
battle start!

Aunn is keeping watch and enjoying the weather
Ash tries to catch her, but she's not a Pokemon.
Risen fall out of a gap in the sky and attack.
