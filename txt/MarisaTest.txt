Scarlet Devil Mansion
BOOM
Marisa: Alright! We’re here to save you from those other dimension people!
Sakuya: Did you have to blow down the door? It wasn’t locked.
Marisa: You seem rather calm... Wait, are you having a tea party?
Sakuya: Well yes. They happened to be quite fond of tea.
Reimu: So Remilia threw a tea party.
Sakuya: Indeed. I was just about to go invite you.
Marisa: Figures you’d end up getting a bunch of sissies.
Caspar: What did you say about me?!?!
Marisa: Uh, who are you?
Caspar: You called me a sissy! Come on! Let’s fight!
Marisa: Sure! Why not! That’s why I came here after all!
Reimu: So we ended up fighting them after all...
Sakuya: So it would seem.
Claude: Excuse me. Might I suggest something?
Sakuya: Go right ahead Mr. Riegan.
Claude: I think we should turn this into a combat exercise. How often do you get to fight people from other universes? 
Sakuya: That indeed sounds interesting, care to join us Reimu?
Reimu: *sigh* I might as well.
Claude: That means you too Hilda!
Hilda: What? But I’m busy over here. Can’t Raphael do it or something?
Raphael: Huh? What?
Claude: That’s fine but I need your help too Hilda. Specifically.
Hilda: I guess when you put it like that...
Ashe: U-um, I would like to join in as well.
Claude: Sure! The more the merrier.
Ashe: No, I mean I want to fight with these people. I think I could learn something new that way.
Claude: Interesting perspective! Well I won’t stop you. If there’s nothing else, let’s get started!
