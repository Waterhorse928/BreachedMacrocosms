Lon'qu: RAH! HA! HA!
Lon'qu: ...For how long do you intend to hide behind that rock?
Kogasa: Boo! Did I scare you?
Lon'qu: ...
Lon'qu: No.
Kogasa: *sniff* You were so scared of those other girls... *sniff* Maybe there isn't anyone I can scare anymore...
Lon'qu: Are you... crying?
Kogasa: Waaaaaaah!
Lon'qu: ...
Kogasa: *sobbing*
Lon'qu: ARGH! Please stop crying!
Kogasa: *sniff* *sob* *sniff*
Lon'qu: Here... do you want... this flower? *throws flower*
Kogasa: ...
Lon'qu: Are you done now?
Kogasa: Gwhahahaha!
Lon'qu: What? Why are you laughing?
Kogasa: You’re terrified! You can’t even get close to me! Hahaha!
Kogasa: You had me fooled! Your face didn’t look scared at all!
Lon'qu: ...If that’s all I’m going to get back to training.
Kogasa: Training? What are you training for?
Lon'qu: I am a warrior. I must train to retain and improve my skill.
Kogasa: Your skill huh... Do you think if I trained I could scare more people than just you?
Lon'qu: ...Perhaps.
Kogasa: Hmm... How do I train though? Wait! You could teach me!
Lon'qu: Absolutely not.
Kogasa: Oh come on! Are you scared?
Lon'qu: ...Fine. Go sit over there and observe.
Kogasa: Yay! You won’t regret it!
Lon'qu: *sigh*
Kogasa: ...
Kogasa: What's your name?
Lon'qu: Lon'qu.
Kogasa: My name's Kogasa!
Kogasa: Now you could say we're acquaintances!
Lon'qu: ...
Lon'qu: HA! RAH! HA!
