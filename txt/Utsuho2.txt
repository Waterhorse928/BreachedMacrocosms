Grunt A: These people are crazy!
Grunt B: Who fights a Pokémon?
Grunt C: Well, I saw something on TV one time…
Utsuho: Since we won… does that mean we get your Pokémon?
Grunt A: Urk!  Well… Um…
Grunt B: You can't! Because… uh…
Grunt C: We don't… have any?
Utsuho: Oh… I wanted to see a Pokémon…
Orin: Okuu, I think the things we fought were Pokémon.
Utsuho: Do you think so? They are pretty cool! I like the puddle one.
Grunt C: Ah! No! Not my Muk!
Grunt B: You can't just take our Pokémon!
Orin: …
Orin: Wasn't that exactly what you were doing?
Grunt B: Oh yeah.
Orin: Well I have a better idea anyway…
Utsuho: Aww…
Orin: Didn't someone say something about money?
Utsuho: Oh yeah! Give us all your money!
Grunt A: ...
Grunt A: Guys? Why are you looking at me like that?
